		This script is designed to be the endpoint for the Salesforce
		SOAP Outbound Messaging. The Salesforce messages are part of the
	  workflow functionality which can be customised to limit the
		conditions under which a notification is sent as well as the 
		subset of SObject fields that is sent as part of the message.
		Salesforce will only send the field if it has a value. It is
		also possible that up to 100 notifications (for separate SObjects)
		to be sent in a single message.

		v1 - Only handles a single notification per message
