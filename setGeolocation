SetGeolocation on Property__c object
    
    Calls a class which does a callout to Google Maps to find out the lat/long for the specified property. This information allows some basic
    mapping of property locations within SalesForce. In future the plan is to use this information for geofencing (knowing where a crew currently is
    and displaying relevant information about the property) as well as route planning.
